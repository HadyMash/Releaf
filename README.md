An app made for the mental health of students, by students.

# About
This is an app made to help students reflect on their lives and feel accomplished/self-fulfilled. We, as students ourselves, know that you don't have a lot of time to work on what you want and often feel stressed or overworked.

That's why we want you to remember the happy moments but also remember that it's ok to sometimes feel a little down, it's normal. You also don't get time do things you want so we helped you make a few yearly goals to work on to help you focus and achieve a few tasks you wanted to get done by this year.

This is an app made for an IB CAS Project, it will not be maintained in the future. There are a lot of inefficiencies that we couldn't get to due to time contrainsts and the fact that this app won't be maintained.
# Features
## Journal
The Journal is a place for you to reflect on certain occasions or points in time. You could be on a trip you want to remember or just feel really happy and want to remember that moment, it's up to you! You upload a picture(s) and write some text and select how you're feeling and boom. You upload and it will be uploaded to the cloud. Please be aware that the text is encrypted but images are not.

## Yearly Goals (Tasks)
You might want to learn something this year or achieve a certain milestone, The 'Tasks' page is the place for that. Put down a few goals every year and try to get them done.

## Meditation
For obvious reasons, this page will not be implemented. There are plenty of meditation resources out there, we hope you can find one which helps.

# Known Bugs/Issues
* You need to close the Tasks page and open it again after deleteing a year.
* Journal is slow to load.
* If you ever get a red screen go to another page and back to the same page, if you do not see the navigation bar then you will need to restart the app.
* Pictures take a long time to load when adding then in the journal entry form initially.

# Help/Support
If you find a bug or have any feature suggestions, please make an issue on this repository.

We will try our best to get to it but we might not as this is an app made for CAS and not a project we intend on mainting.
